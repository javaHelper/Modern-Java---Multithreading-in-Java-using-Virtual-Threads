# Modern-Java---Multithreading-in-Java-using-Virtual-Threads

What is a Java Thread, Why do we need them ?
- Starting Java 21, we have two types of Threads:
  - Platform Threads (aka Java Threads until 20)
  - Virtual Threads

- Platform Threads in Java are used to run tasks in the background.
- This allows a program to execute multiple things at the same time withoutinterrupting the main thread.
